<h1>Which one is the best language for data science?</h1>
<p>While there are many pros and cons of each, it ultimately comes down to your own personal preference. For instance, there are many things that Rstudio can do that Python can’t and vice versa. On the flip side, Rstudio and Python can do a lot of the same things but they just use different code to get there. If I haven’t confused you enough, something that I actually found to be really neat is that you can actually use both at the same time! You might ask how is that even possible?! Let me show you:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)
show &lt;- &quot;Cheers to&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>show = &quot;Class of 2020&quot;
print(r.show, show)
## Cheers to Class of 2020</code></pre>
<p>By using the reticulate package, I was able to use both R and Python interchangeably. Using the R code chunk, I assigned “Cheers to” to “show”. Using the Python code chunk, I also assigned “Class of 2020” to “show”. Then I printed both “show” together to get “Cheers to class of 2020”. It is important to note that when I went to go print the code chunk, I put an “r.” in front of “show” in order to access the R-defined object since I’m in the Python code chunk. If I was in the R code chunk, I would put “py$” in front of “show” instead.</p>
