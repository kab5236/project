      <description>Yes yes these pythons are cool but let’s look at what else you can do with the Python programming language…
Functions in Python def count_chars(sentence): counts = {} for c in sentence: if c in counts: counts[c]+=1 else: counts[c]=1 for c in counts: print(c, &amp;quot;appears&amp;quot;, counts[c],&amp;quot;times&amp;quot;) new_sentence = &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m bored in the house and I&amp;#39;m in the house bored.&amp;quot; count_chars(new_sentence) ## I appears 2 times ## &amp;#39; appears 2 times ## m appears 2 times ## appears 10 times ## b appears 2 times ## o appears 4 times ## r appears 2 times ## e appears 6 times ## d appears 3 times ## i appears 2 times ## n appears 3 times ## t appears 2 times ## h appears 4 times ## u appears 2 times ## s appears 2 times ## a appears 1 times ## .</description>

      <description>Introduction library(tidyverse) voterturnout &amp;lt;- read.csv(&amp;quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-10-09/voter_turnout.csv&amp;quot;) catdog &amp;lt;- read.csv(&amp;quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2018/2018-09-11/cats_vs_dogs.csv&amp;quot;) I chose two datasets for my project: one that I named as “voterturnout” and another I named as “catdog”. The voterturnout dataset contains information regarding the number of votes and eligible voters for all 50 states for every 2 years from 1980-2014. The specific variables in the dataset include: X, year, icpsr_state_code, alphanumeric_state_code, state, votes, and eligible_voters. The catdog dataset gives various data about cat and dog households/owners across all 50 states.</description>

      <description>Which one is the best language for data science? It seems like there is this great big divide between R users and Python users, with individuals on each side believing that their choice of language is the superior one. Even a quick Google search shows millions of results comparing the two. The reality is that R and Python can actually do a lot of the same things but just use a different code to get there.</description>
